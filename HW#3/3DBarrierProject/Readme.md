## Acknowledgement
I used hey franky font for the button and text elements in UI. It is free for personal use. You can check it from [here](https://www.dafont.com/hey-franky.font).
I recorded a short part from godfather theme music and put it as audio in the game. You can check the original and much better version from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWqKPWO5T4o).
